Contained herein are the scripts used for all computational analysis conducted for the 2021 article _Kinship norms moderate human energy use_ by Jacob Freeman, Jacopo A. Baggio, Lux Miranda, and John M. Anderies, submitted to the _Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences_. 

Within the ``KinshipMetric`` directory is the data and Python code used to create the kinship intensity index primarily described in the SI. The ``Infrastructure.tar.lrz`` is a tarball containing the R scripts used for all other analysis. It may be extracted with ``lrztar -d Infrastructure.tar.lrz`` or using your preferred zipping/compression manager, provided it supports LZMA compression.
